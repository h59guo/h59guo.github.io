        <p>This is where I began to know the world, to grow up, from a boy, to a man.</p>
        <p>We always hear people say that the environment one is living in has a crucial influence on one's personality, and that is abolutely correct. Here at No.28 Middle school, I met a great mentor and a whole class of awosome guys who totally changed my life path.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Under their inpact, I learned the importance of hard working - IQ is a significant factor to determine one's potential, but it is not the only one. It is us that really decide what we really want to be. This becomes my motto since the first time I heard about it.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Academically, I didn't learn anything that is professional, since it was only at middle school, but I did develop my interest and ability to carry on into the field of math and science.</p>

    <h1>No.2 High School</h1>
    <h3>Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China</h3>
        <p>
            If No.28 Middle school is where I get to know what to learn, No.2 High school is where I actually learned knowledge. At No.2 High School, I laid a solid basis for my career in mathematics to go on through two yearsâ€™ hard working in basic knowledge of math, physics, chemstry, biology, etc., and this is where I choose science, specifically math, to be the one that is with me whole my life.
        </p>
        <p>
        However, knowledge is not the only thing I acquired at No.2 high school. The most important fortune that I got there is the interpersonal skills to make friends. I'm not a nerd who studys all day long. It's said that the friends made in high school are truly the lifetime friends. I totally agree with that idea. Now my friends are studying all kinds of different fields, but it does not get in our way of sharing ideas about how the world goes; on the contrary we learn new ideas from each other every time we met!</p>
        <p>The two years at No.2 High school is undoubtedly the most memorable and precious period in my 19 years life. </p>

        <h1>New Oriental International College</h1>
        <h3>Scarborough, ON, Canada</h3>
        <p>
            The decision to study abroad in Canada was made since I discovered my interest in Computer Science, and I need some time to adapt myself with Canadian life style. This is why I tell people that NOIC is the bridge between me and the university.

        </p>
    <br>
        <p>
            One year at NOIC was the most relaxed but also the most fruitful year in my life. Unlike high school in China, where I almost wrote papers and did all kinds of practice questions for a whole bunch of exams everyday, here at NOIC, what I did is hanging out everyday! 
        </p>
    <br>
        <p>
            Since I had learned all the science courses in China, all I needed to do was to learn English. I went to Montreal during the break in March. I did volunteer works - cooking meals at a church for homeless people. I visited every interesting place in Toronto. This year was full of fun. On the other hand, I did not throw my academic away - I developed my interest in CS for a higher level, I learned Java on my own, and I achieved 1% of the Euclid Contest held by the Math faculty of the University of Waterloo! It was really a great time!

        <br>
        <p>I improved my programming skills to an even more advanced level and learned more languages through taking a variety of courses involving C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Racket. <a href="HTML.html">Check my skills here</a> I became a specialist in analyzing problems, thanks to the statistics and logic courses the school offers.</p>
        <p>I also met many brilliant friends here, as well as some talented professors, my story at the University of Waterloo, has just started.</p>

        <h3>Toronto, ON, Canada</h3>
        <p>Working at Nulogy is an unforgettable experience. I learned not only how a technical company works, how a project is designed and implemented, but also how people are communicating to each other and how pleasant your life working at a tech company can be.</p>
        <br>
        <p>My position at Nulogy is System Integration Developer. Basically what I did was writting transforms using XSLT to transform X12 files that our partners sent us to standard XML files so that our Packmanager system would recognize and process them</p>
        <br>
        <p>I also worked on the B2Bi migration project, which was a lot of testing and documentations. A little bit boring, but it showed me the subtlety of being a successful coder :)</p>
        <p>It is just as great as you could imagine!</p>
